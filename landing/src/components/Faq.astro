    // Package-specific questions
    {
        question: "What's included in the app packages?",
        answer: "Each app package includes a custom-designed responsive web app with core features. The Startup Core focuses on MVP with one core feature, Startup Plus offers enhanced functionality with three features, and Startup Pro provides a comprehensive solution ready for scaling."
    },
    {
        question: "How long does it take to deliver an app package?",
        answer: "Delivery times vary by package: Startup Core takes 2-3 weeks, Startup Plus requires 4-6 weeks, and Startup Pro takes 8-10 weeks. These timelines ensure thorough development and quality assurance."
    },
    {
        question: "What technologies are used in the app packages?",
        answer: "I primarily use a modern tech stack including Vue.js/Nuxt for frontend, NestJS with TypeScript for backend, and relational databases. The specific technologies are chosen to best suit your project's requirements."
    },
    // Process and Communication
    {
        question: "How does the development process work?",
        answer: "After choosing a package, we'll have an initial consultation to define your requirements in detail. Development is done in phases with regular updates and feedback sessions. You'll have access to the codebase throughout the development process."
    },
    {
        question: "How do meetings and communication work?",
        answer: "I offer meetings as needed throughout the development process. Regular updates are provided via email or your preferred communication channel. We'll have scheduled check-ins at key development milestones."
    },
    {
        question: "What are your working hours?",
        answer: "I operate Monday through Friday, excluding national holidays, within Central European working hours (I'm based in Poland). This allows for efficient communication with clients across European and American time zones."
    },
    // Deliverables and Code
    {
        question: "How do I receive the completed code?",
        answer: "Code is delivered through a private GitHub repository. You'll have full access to the source code, documentation, and deployment guides. I can also assist with setting up your own repository if needed."
    },
    {
        question: "What if I need changes after delivery?",
        answer: "Each package includes a revision period where you can request adjustments to ensure everything meets your requirements. After the initial delivery, we can discuss ongoing maintenance or additional development needs."
    },
    {
        question: "How do you ensure code quality?",
        answer: "I maintain high code quality through comprehensive testing, code reviews, adherence to coding standards, and using modern development tools. All code is properly documented and follows industry best practices."
    },
    // Business and Legal
    {
        question: "Can we sign a Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA)?",
        answer: "Absolutely. I understand that projects often involve sensitive information or proprietary technology. I'm happy to sign an NDA before discussing your project details to ensure full confidentiality."
    },
    {
        question: "What are the payment terms?",
        answer: "I use a straightforward 50-25-25 payment structure: 50% upfront to begin development, 25% at the midpoint milestone, and 25% upon completion. This structure ensures clear expectations and helps maintain a steady development pace while sharing the risk fairly."
    },
    {
        question: "What payment methods do you accept?",
        answer: "I accept over 250 payment methods worldwide, including credit/debit cards, PayPal, Google Pay, Apple Pay, and Klarna. This ensures you can choose the most convenient payment option for your location and preference. All payments are processed securely through an established payment processor."
    },
    {
        question: "Is the payment process secure?",
        answer: "Absolutely. All payments are processed through a secure, PCI-compliant payment system. Your payment information is never stored on my servers, and all transactions are protected by industry-standard encryption."
    },
    {
        question: "What if I need more features than what's included in a package?",
        answer: "If you need additional features, we can either upgrade to a more comprehensive package or discuss custom additions. Each package is designed to be flexible enough to accommodate specific requirements."
    },
    {
        question: "Do you provide ongoing support after launch?",
        answer: "While the packages focus on initial development, I offer various options for ongoing support and maintenance. We can discuss these needs based on your specific requirements."
    },
    {
        question: "Where are you based and how does it affect the project?",
        answer: "I operate from Poland, which allows me to offer competitive pricing while maintaining high-quality service. Working in European time zones enables efficient collaboration with clients worldwide, particularly in Europe and the Americas."
