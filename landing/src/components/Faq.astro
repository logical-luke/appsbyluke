        question: "What's included in the MVP Launch package?",
        answer: "For $2,499, I deliver a complete MVP in 2 weeks that includes your core feature implementation, professional design, user management, payment processing, mobile-friendly interface, and full hosting setup. Everything needed to launch is included - no hidden costs. Optional AI integration is available if your product needs it."
    },
    {
        question: "How does the Ongoing Support work?",
        answer: "After launching your MVP, you can opt for ongoing support at $2,999/month. This includes 50 hours of development time, weekly strategy calls, continuous improvements, maintenance, and same-day emergency support. This option is exclusively available for my MVP Launch clients."
    },
    {
        question: "How does the pay-after-delivery work?",
        answer: "Simple - I build your MVP first, and you pay when it's delivered. No upfront costs, no risks. Once your MVP is complete and deployed, you make the one-time payment of $2,499."
    },
    {
        question: "What about hosting and infrastructure costs?",
        answer: "All hosting, domain setup, SSL certificates, and infrastructure costs are included in the MVP Launch package. I handle the complete technical setup so you don't have to worry about additional costs or technical configurations."
    },
    {
        question: "What about VAT and other taxes?",
        answer: "Prices shown are exclusive of VAT. VAT will be calculated based on your location and business status. Businesses applicable may qualify for VAT reverse-charge."
    },
    {
        question: "How does the development process work?",
        answer: "We start with a discovery call to understand your vision. Once aligned, I begin development on agreed time and deliver your MVP within 2 weeks. You'll receive regular updates throughout the process, and everything is set up ready for launch upon delivery."
    },
    {
        question: "What technologies do you use?",
        answer: "I use Vue.js/Nuxt with Tailwind CSS for the frontend, ensuring a modern and responsive user experience. The backend uses NestJS with TypeScript for reliable, scalable server-side code. This modern stack ensures your product is fast, maintainable, and ready to grow."
    },
    {
        question: "How can AI enhance my MVP?",
        answer: "If your product could benefit from AI capabilities, I can integrate services like ChatGPT or other AI models. This could include features like content generation, data analysis, or smart automation - we'll discuss the possibilities during our initial call."
    },
    {
        question: "Can I track the development progress?",
        answer: "Yes, you'll have access to my project management platform where you can track all tasks and progress in real-time. I also provide regular email updates throughout the development process."
    },
    {
        question: "How is the infrastructure handled?",
        answer: "I take care of everything - hosting setup, security configuration, SSL certificates, and deployment. Your application will be hosted on reliable cloud infrastructure, fully secured and ready for your users."
    },
    {
        question: "What security measures are implemented?",
        answer: "Security is implemented at multiple levels: secure code practices, encrypted data transmission, industry-standard authentication, and GDPR-compliant data processing. All security best practices are followed to protect your application and users."
    },
    {
        question: "What are your working hours?",
        answer: "I work Monday through Friday, 9:00 AM - 5:00 PM CET (Central European Time), excluding Polish holidays. This allows for efficient communication with clients across European and American time zones."
    },
    {
        question: "How do updates and communication work?",
        answer: "You'll receive regular progress updates via email and have direct access to me through appropriate communication channels. For ongoing support clients, we'll have weekly strategy calls to discuss progress and plans."
    },
    {
        question: "How is my project's confidentiality protected?",
        answer: "All client information and project details are treated as strictly confidential. I'm happy to sign an NDA before discussing your project details if needed."
    },
    {
        question: "Who owns the code?",
        answer: "Upon successful payment after delivery, you receive full ownership of all custom code and assets created for your project. Until payment is completed, I retain all rights to the code and intellectual property. In case of non-payment, I reserve the right to use, modify, or commercialize the developed solution as I see fit."
    },
    {
        question: "What happens if I don't pay after delivery?",
        answer: "If payment is not made after delivery, you won't receive any rights to the code or intellectual property. I retain full ownership and rights to use, modify, or launch the application independently. To protect both parties, it's crucial to ensure you're committed to the project before development begins."
