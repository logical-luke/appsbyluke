The current month's fee is non-refundable, but you'll retain access to the service for the remainder of the paid period. There is also an option to pause your subscription in case you decided on an option with payment for a longer period than monthly."

If your project involves sensitive information or proprietary technology, I'm more than willing to sign a Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA) before starting work. This ensures that your intellectual property and business secrets are fully protected throughout our collaboration."
