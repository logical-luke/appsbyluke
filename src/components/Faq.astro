                        question: "How do I get started with AppsByLuke?",
                        answer: "After subscribing to a plan, you'll receive an email shortly after granting access to your personal project management board. That's all you'll need to begin submitting your requests."

                        answer: "I offer meetings as needed, but I apply a fair-use policy. This means I prioritize efficient communication and coding time. Regular updates are provided through your project management board."

                        question: "How do unlimited requests work?",
